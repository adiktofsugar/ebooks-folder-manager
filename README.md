I'm tired of calibre. All I want is to add minimal metadata to my books and keep them in a folder.

# Multiple formats

Are not supported. This is a file based project. If something like this seems necessary, I'll add an "extract metadata" and "apply metadata" command, and then you can use this to make one book the "main" book, or do some complicated merge on your own, or whatever.

# Sync to device

It would be nice to connect to a device to see which ones are already there. To do so, I'll let you navigate to a folder that represents a device and scan that folder for existing folders.
