I'm tired of calibre. All I want is to add minimal metadata to my books and keep them in a folder.

# Organization

Flat list of files that represent books. It doesn't need to be a folder as ebooks are special formats that have embedded data. To manage different versions, I'll need to prefer one format over another.

## Prefer one format over another

I just want to dump the files into a folder and then pull the metadata to populate a database, then populate the edits to whatever the files came from.

This means that on import, I'll have multiple sources of truth. I could have an epub, pdf, and mobi version of the same file, and need to make the metadata the same for all of them.

I guess I'll just have to pull the metadata out for all of them and show some sort of diff.

# Sync to device

It would be nice to connect to a device to see which ones are already there. To do so, I'll let you navigate to a folder that represents a device and scan that folder for existing folders.
